        <p>Hello! Welcome to my first post. I hope this post paves the path for more substances in the future. 
In this blog, I hope to discuss/share my love for programming, music, food through a different approach. </p>

<p>To start off, I want my first definitive post to discuss why I am doing this.</p>

<p>OK. HERE WE GO....</p>

<p>I grew up hating the idea of not being comptent. Who doesn&#39;t, right? I hated when I got beat in sports. I hated when I didn&#39;t receive good grades. I HATED BEING A FAILURE. Even throughout my undergrad years and stepping into the profession world, my mentality was still the same -- don&#39;t do things you suck at or don&#39;t suck at things at all. I remember being tough on myself for making small mistakes because I associated mistakes with failure. However, something changed along the way. Throughout the journey as a software developer, I discovered that my outook on failure had changed. Perhaps, it was the struggle of learning new frameworks, fixing small bugs, or spending countless hours working on programming related issues that helped me become more receptive towards failure. Maybe this sorta talk won&#39;t work for everybody, but for myself, I can proudly say that failure has taught me the steps of being good at something.   </p>

<p>That&#39;s going to be the essence of this blog. Whenever I discuss my development process, I am going to show where I failed, only to show how I got it right eventually. </p>
